# RadiologyReportGen-AI

## Advanced AI for Automated Radiology Report Generation

RadiologyReportGen-AI is a cutting-edge machine learning project designed to automate the generation of radiology reports, with a specific focus on chest X-ray imaging. This repository offers a complete solution employing Vision Transformers (ViT) for sophisticated image feature extraction and the GPT-2 model for generating detailed radiology reports.

### Key Features

- **Image Feature Extraction**: Utilizes Vision Transformers to analyze chest X-ray images effectively.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs a fine-tuned GPT-2 model for generating coherent and detailed radiology reports.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Integrates comprehensive chest X-ray datasets for accurate and contextually relevant report generation.
- **Research-Oriented**: Facilitates further research and development in the field of AI-driven medical imaging and report generation.
